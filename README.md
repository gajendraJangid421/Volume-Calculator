# Volume-Calculator

Volume Calculator is a calculator to calculate the volume of different 3D shapes like Sphere, Cone, Cuboid, Cylinder, etc.

There are two different ways to enter the value, one by typing and other by voice.

Also, the value can be entered in equation form like (1+2*3).

And on one click the result is out and also a speaker is added to hear the result.

Also, formulae are added for each shape to know how the volume is calculated.
